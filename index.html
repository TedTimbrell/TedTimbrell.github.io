		      <h2>About Me</h2>
		      <p>Originally from NJ, I'm currently living in San Francisco working as a Software Engineer for a startup. I graduated from CWRU (glorious Cleveland, Ohio) in May 2019 with a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. Prior to my current gig I've had four internships and a research position with a machine learning lab (Thank you Dr. Ray). I'm new to the Bay Area so please reach out if you think I might be interested in a project, group, or idea.</p>

		      <h2>WorldView</h2>
		      <p>WorldView was a project I came up with and worked on for my Software Engineering course (ya know, the one with all the UML diagrams and design documents). The project never ended up in quite the completed state I'd wanted it sadly, but the idea I think is a noble one. WorldView was designed to query the same URL from various locations across the glove and compare the relative output to detect if a news site is censoring or catering content for a certain audience. More insidious than fake news is simply living in our own realities. WorldView was hoping to make that more difficult.</p>
